                Post harvest losses constitute a significant 20% chunk of the global agricultural<br>
                produce. The number goes up to 40% for fruits and vegetables. The main reason<br>
                for the losses are the inefficient cold storage capacities with the farmers.<br>
                The reason behind farmers storing their produce is the fluctuation in the pricing<br>
                anticipating a higher price in future. The root cause for the fluctuations are the <br>
                presence multiple middlemen present in the supply chain increasing the supply chain<br>
                cost with negligible value addition. Both the ends of supply chain farmers and processors<br>
                face losses with farmer bearing the maximum impact. Startups in the ecosystem provide a <br>
                marketplace to facilitate farmer-processor trade but with the regulation in price that<br>
                space is also occupied by middlemen.
                <br><br><br>
                Nutshell provides a SaaS based platform enabling direct trade between farmer and processor.<br>
                The model is similar to Uber where the processor(Passenger) enter their demand(destination) <br>
                and the software provides the nearest farmer(driver) who can satisfy the order(ride). Apart <br>
                from this just like Uber has a fixed cost which varies only on the distance we at Nutshell also<br>
                 have our own platform price varying only on the crop traded. The price we fix on the platform <br>
                 remains constant for a month removing the worries about fluctuation in prices. This has been<br>
                  achieved by deployed deep learning models and trained them across various datasets and taking <br>
                  the forecasted price from them and finally performing statistical modelling to level it for a<br>
                   period of one month. We are the only company which deal with regulating the prices other than<br>
                    the government's MSP. Our revenue comes from two ways, One as a monthly subscription fee for<br>
                     the farmers to list their produce on the platform and another a per order commission from<br>
                      the processor side based on the order quantity. Our final goal is to establish a perfect<br>
                       farm2fork supply chain and connecting processors has been our first step to achieve our vision.
